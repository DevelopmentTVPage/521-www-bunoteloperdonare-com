    "description": "Hey guys!  Get this video to 1,000 likes and I will upload an Elder Scrolls Total War Siege Battle!\n\nBattle of Minas Ithil\n\"A long-tilted valley, a deep gulf of shadow, ran back far into the mountains. Upon the further side, some way within the valley's arms, high on a rocky seat upon the black knees of the Ephel D\u00faath, stood the walls and towers of Minas Morgul. All was dark about it, earth and sky, but it was lit with light. Not the imprisoned moonlight welling through the marble walls of Minas Ithil long ago, Tower of the Moon, fair and radiant in the hollow of the hills. Paler indeed than the moon ailing in some slow eclipse was the light of it now, wavering and blowing like a noisome exhalation of decay, a corpse-light, a light that illuminated nothing.\"\nAfter the destruction of N\u00famenor, the escapees landed in Middle-earth where they founded realms-in-exile. The sons of Elendil (Isildur and An\u00e1rion) landed in Gondor, and Isildur was assigned its eastern province of Ithilien. There he built the city of Minas Ithil on the south side of a pleasant valley in the mountains bordering Mordor. (At the same time An\u00e1rion built the twin city of Minas Anor further west across the Anduin. The brothers had their thrones side by side in Osgiliath, the first capital of Gondor.) Isildur planted a sapling of the White Tree Nimloth outside his home in Minas Ithil, and one of the seven palant\u00edri was kept in the tower. The city's white marble walls, buildings, and tower were designed to catch and reflect the moonlight, and shone with a soft silver luminescence.\n\nSauron had survived N\u00famenor's destruction, but his return to Mordor was not known until he attacked the exiles of N\u00famenor.\n\nIn SA 3429, Sauron sent a huge army from Gorgoroth to besiege Minas Ithil. An army of Gondorians under Isildur defended the city. In the course of the siege, Sauron's forces drove into the fortress and set fire to the White Tree. Isildur, his wife, his sons, and an unknown number of Gondorian soldiers escaped the citadel, and Isildur brought with him a seedling of the White Tree. Isildur's family retreated to Elendil, while An\u00e1rion, hearing of the fall of Minas Ithil, sent a strong force to garrison Osgiliath in the advent of attack. \n\nFollowing the capture of Minas Ithil, the Army of Mordor terrorized the Eastern side of the Anduin, then a territory of Gondor. The battle sparked the War of the Last Alliance, and led to the Western kingdoms forming an alliance to, so they hoped, stop Sauron once and for all. Minas Ithil was retaken a year later, but by the Third Age, the citadel was nearly abandoned. \nBut in TA 2002, a sudden army under the command of the witchking and the nazghul arrived at Minas Ithil....Can the defenders hold this precious stronghold for gondor or will the forces of darkness reclaim a precious stronghold?....\n\nDownload Battle:\nMultiplayer: http:\/\/www.mediafire.com\/download\/mtmhr1g2907m0eh\/minas_ithilM.rar\n\nSingle Player:\nhttp:\/\/www.mediafire.com\/download\/d7ob2bm9j1xg01b\/minas_ithil.rar\n_\nVisit my Website & Podcast!\n\nThanks to this awesome community I built a website for Total War fans, gamers, and history nerds.
