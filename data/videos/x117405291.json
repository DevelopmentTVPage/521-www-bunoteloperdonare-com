    "description": "Battle of  Lothl\u00f3rien 3019AD-\nor otherwise known as the siege of Caras Galadhon ,  the heart of the Silvan Elven realm, it was built in the middle of, on top of, and out of the Mallorn trees that Galadriel have received from Tar-Aldarion, the seventh High King of N\u00famenor, and was thenceforth the residence of Celeborn and Galadriel.\nCaras Galadhon is circular in shape and about three-thousand feet from east to west and was surrounded by a wall of green earth and a ditch or a moat called the Deep Fosse. On the western border, a long stone road outside the Deep Fosse ran for many dozens of miles also surrounded the city. The only entrance was in the south through a set of Great Gates across a bridge in the Deep Fosse. \nThe city was a host of Mallorn trees where the elves lived in flets a top the trees. Located in the city's center, atop the largest Mallorn in the city, was the flet of Celeborn and Galadriel and the Chamber of Celeborn. \nLothlorien was assaulted 3 times during the war of the ring in a co-ordinated attack by sauron also attacking mirkwood and dale&erebor. But aided by magic from Lady Galadriel and the forces of  Lord Celeborn , the forces of the Galadhrim of Lothl\u00f3rien resist this last and final attack by the orcs from dol guldur which is reinforced by orcs from gundabad & goblins from Moria. But hope remains....the rohorrim have beaten back saruman and can spare some meagre cavalry and treebeard has sent some huorns[weak trees controlled by ents] to keep the forest realm in the fight.\nHold the line and defeat the hordes and perhaps there is a chance of a co-ordinated counterattack on Dol Guldur as the nazgul have now left that place...\nAftermath : It is unknown how the Orc army crossed the River Anduin, though the North Undeep seems the most likely place to ford. Forces from Dol Guldur, reinforced with Orcs from Mordor assaulted Lothl\u00f3rien three times, assisted at least once in a joint attack from the west by the Goblins of Moria. Though the battles are not described in detail by Tolkien, the fair woods of the borders of Lothl\u00f3rien suffered grievous harm by fire, though the valour of the Elves prevented the enemy from penetrating too deeply into their forest realm. Thrice the enemy attacked, and the three times the assaults were driven back. The valour of the Elven people that lived in L\u00f3rien was great, but Tolkien states that the main reason why L\u00f3rien was not conquered was \"the power that dwelt there was far too great for any to overcome, save if Sauron had come there himself\". Such power was the Lady Galadriel, wearing Nenya, who was able to defeat the Orcs; who then fled south towards into Fangorn Forest. Treebeard and a host of Ents, having already laid ruin to Isengard some days before set out to prevent them entering Rohan. The despairing Orcs fled eastward but were either killed by the tree-shepherds, drowned in the River Anduin or fled to Dol Guldur.\nDuring the Fourth Age, after Galadriel had left L\u00f3rien, Caras Galadhon was ruled by a lonely Celeborn as capital of a L\u00f3rien which now spanned both sides of the river Anduin, but at some point during the age he left for Valinor as well, and Caras Galadhon slowly became depopulated. It is unclear just how this came about since most of L\u00f3rien's people were Silvan Elves and, presumably, not necessarily inclined to leave Middle-earth so soon after Sauron's fall; there are different references to the Fate of the Elves of Middle-earth scattered throughout Tolkien's published works. Caras Galadhon is called a \"great city\" in the Lord of the Rings, and the impression is that its population numbered in the thousands. However, the \"Tale of Aragorn and Arwen\" in Appendix A depicts Caras Galadhon as wholly abandoned by the time of Aragorn II Elessar's death\n\nSiege of Dol Guldur: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=HPgE5Y8NO1Q\n\nDownload the Scenario here: \nSingle Player: http:\/\/www.mediafire.com\/download\/utd27q32zmp1t42\/lothlorien_sp.rar\n\nMultiplayer: http:\/\/www.mediafire.com\/download\/qf5751c433ga7gb\/lothlorien_mpv3.rar \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nConnect With me!\n\nEmail: pixelatedapollo@gmail.com\nTwitter: https:\/\/twitter.com\/PixelatedApollo\nSteam Group:  http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/groups\/apollosknights\nTwitch: http:\/\/www.twitch.tv\/pixelatedapollo\nTeamSpeak: thewarcamp.vortexservers.com:10124",
