    "description": "Welcome to the Siege of Harfleur, this took place on 18 August 1415,  during the Hundred years war. The English, under the command of King Henry V, sieged the Coastal Castle of Harfleur. The French held on, because they thought reinforcements would arrive....but aid never showed and they surrendered the Castle to the English.  But what if they did arrive? What if King Charles VI march a massive relief force, to save the garrison army? This is an alternate historical battle, and it about to come to life! Enjoy!\n\nIn the battle I command King Henry V's and half his army, Warrior of Sparta command the 2nd half of the English Army.\n\nJackie Fish Commands the French Garrison force, and Diplex Heated command King Charles VI relief force!\n\nCheck out Their Channels:\n\nWarrior of Sparta: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/1984warriorofsparta\n\nJackie Fish: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/Jackiefishhhhhh\n\nDiplexHeated: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/DiplexHeatedHD\n\n_\nVisit my Website & Podcast!\n\nThanks to this awesome community I built a website for Total War fans, gamers, and history nerds.
