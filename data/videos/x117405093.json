    "description": "Third Age Total War Gameplay - The Dunedains were marching to Rivendell and lead by their supreme Commander, Isildur. This man proved himself to be worthy of caring the ring by slaying Sauron. He left the majority of his army after the War of the Last Alliance and only his personnal elite guards.\n\nBut the spirit of the dark lord remained in the ring and called upon the remnants of his fallen armies. The orcish bands assembled in the dark forest to ambush the young hero of the middle earth. Blinded by victory, Isildur wasn't aware of his surroundings and let his mens sings ans drink all night long.\n\nAt the morning when the rains was heavy and blocked the field of view of dunedains scouts, the silence of the forest awoke the presence of danger. Isildur knew that orcs were near and prepared his men to face the unstoppable force. They knew that they were outnumber and by far, at least 10 times.\n\nThe supreme command of dunedains orders one of his men to run and alarm the silvan elves who were established nearby to come and rescue them. Or will they only find the corpses of the fallen knights... \n\nMade by KuroGuroChan\n\nBattle Link: http:\/\/www.mediafire.com\/download\/9ofcumfn4fm0iwx\/Gladdens_fields.rar\n\n\nIf you enjoyed the video don't forget to Like and Leave a comment :D\n\n-----------------------------------------PA Merchandise----------------------------------------------\n\nRepresent the Knight's of Apollo!\nBuy a T-shirt Here: http:\/\/shop.spreadshirt.com\/pixelatedapollo\/\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGreen Man Gaming Link:\nhttp:\/\/www.greenmangaming.com\/?tap_a=1964-996bbb&tap_s=29753-aa0a78\n\nGreen Man Gaming Discount Code 20% Off:\nPIXELA-TEDAPO-LLOSVE\n\n----------------------------------How You Can Support Me! -----------------------------------\n\n- Like, share and leave a comment :D\n- Turn OFF adblock or whitelist my channel\n- Buy a Game from Green Man Gaming (Use the Link Above) \n- Send me a GREAT battle Replay: pixelatedapollo@gmail.com\n\n------------------------------------------Connect With Me!-----------------------------------------\n\n- Email: pixelatedapollo@gmail.com\n- Twitter: https:\/\/twitter.com\/PixelatedApollo\n- Steam Group:  http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/groups\/apollosknights\n- Twitch: http:\/\/www.twitch.tv\/pixelatedapollo",
