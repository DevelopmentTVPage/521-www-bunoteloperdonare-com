    "description": "Epic Siege of the Cursed Army: Middle-earth Battle  - Third Age Total War Reforged Gameplay - There is rumor of an enchanted village that holds a powerful artifact.  It is protected by a cursed army that will kill anyone who goes near it.  Looking to gain power, 3 different factions surround the village ready to kill the cursed army and anyone else who stands in their way, but only one faction will be left standing.  This is a custom siege battle that is a 1v2v2v3.  One player commands the army of the undead.  There are 2 armies of the orcs of the Misty Mountains, 2 Isengard armies, and 3 armies from the Free Peoples of Middle-earth. (Dwarves, Elves, and Men.) The Undead army must defend the town center at all cost.
