If you enjoyed the video don't forget to leave a comment and a Like :D\n\nBattle of Dol Guldur 3019TA -\n\nThe forces of the Galadrim with help from the Ents and some help from rohan have resisted the attempt of the forces of Sauron to destroy the elves of Lothlorien.Four times they were attacked and in each the mighty elves [with sometimes the help of allies] have driven back the forces of darkness. But in every battle there is a moment to counter and the time is now ....\n\n So then on March 28, Celeborn led many Elves from Lothl\u00f3rien across the river Anduin in a fleet of boats. The elves invaded. When they reached Dol Guldur, a defense had already been prepared and the siege endured some days. The usual guardians, the Nazg\u00fbl, were gone, and the forces from Dol Guldur prepared to counter the enemy forces of the elves with wargs and spiders collected from the forest of mirkwood at a last attempt to throw back the forces of the elves.\n\nBut Galadriel herself is said to also be bringing her magic to bear on the mighty fortress....can the elves under Celeborn , Haldir and Radagast destroy the orcs or will the magic of the elves have to be brought forth once again to destroy the guardians of the evil fortress....\n\naftermath : When the fortress was surrounded, Galadriel slowly walked to the fortified gate of the fortress. Orcish arrows flew about her, yet her Elven Ring protected her. With a gentle push from her ladyship, the gates swung forward and Galadriel with her ring cast down the walls, foul pits, crevices, caused grasses, and fruit trees to grow. The evil realm of Dol Guldur was finally destroyed. Galadriel caused an Elanor flower to grow in the middle of the old fortress. The forest was cleansed. \n\nOn April 6, Celeborn and King Thranduil met in the midst of the forest and renamed it Eryn Lasgalen \"wood of green leaves\". Celeborn took the land south of The Narrows for himself and named it East L\u00f3rien, while Thranduil took all wood north of the Mountains of Mirkwood, and they gave the middle of the wood to the Beornings and Woodmen.\n\nPlay the Battle -\n\nSingleplayer: http:\/\/www.mediafire.com\/download\/5fwcec1wplmvc7f\/dol_guldur_sp.rar\n\nMultiplayer: http:\/\/www.mediafire.com\/download\/vpuw6cc9l6db53e\/dol_guldur_mpv3.rar\n_\nVisit my Website & Podcast!\n\nThanks to this awesome community I built a website for Total War fans, gamers, and history nerds.
