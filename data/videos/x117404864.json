    "description": "Sacking of Rome: Empire of Charles V - Medieval Kingdoms Total War 1212AD Mod Gameplay - This is a recreation of the sacking of Rome 1527.  Charles V has brought an army of 20,000 Soldiers to the gates of Rome.  Rome only has a small force of about 5,000 men. The battle is a nasty one, and Rome is completely sacked. 1,000 defending troop are executed, and about 45,000 citizens are murdered, wounded, and exiled.  It was a sad day for Europe, and some say the end of the Italian renaissance.  In this recreation of the battle we are using the Mod for Total War Attila called Medieval Kingdoms Total War 1212AD.  There are 4 attacking armies, taking on 3 defending Italian armies.
