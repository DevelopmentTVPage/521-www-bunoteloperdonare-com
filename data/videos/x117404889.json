I really enjoy it, and what you see here is my 5th game ever as the Orks in Warhammer 40K Dawn of War 3.  This is a 3v3 multiplayer match and both my teammates are playing as the Eldar.  The 3 opponents are playing as the Eldar and Space Marines.  This match has some very epic moments.  Let me know what you think of the game!
