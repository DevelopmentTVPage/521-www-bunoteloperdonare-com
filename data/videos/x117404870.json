    "description": "Crossing of Poros: Gondor & Rohan Stand United - Third Age Total War Mod Gameplay - The year is 2885 TA and Sauron has commanded his allies to attack and slowly bleed Gondor's manpower.  Harad used the Harad Road and crossed Poros River to attack Gondor.  But Gondor does not stand alone, Rohan fulfilled their oath and sent men to help them.  It was a costly victory for the men of the west.  This is a custom Battle made by PaladinBob for Third Age Total War.  It is a 3v3 battle.
