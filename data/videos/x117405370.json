    "description": "Welcome Back to Tug of War!  I'm sorry for the delay, but because of server issues with steam we could not play the next part!  But they fixed it and we are good to go!  This time we call for aid and Warrior of Sparta and Alex the Rambler will be joining us today!  Warrior is commanding Dale and helping jackie Fish.  And Alex is teaming up with me, commanding the High Elves.  I must take back this settlement for the glory of my people!  Enjoy :D\n\nP.S. The battle was really laggy for the Live version, so I had to do a post commentary for the battle replay!  Also be sure to check out Jackie's video when it comes out, and Like it :D\n\nJackie's Channel: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/Jackiefishhhhhh\nWarrior: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/1984warriorofsparta\nAlex: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/therambler146\n_\nVisit my Website & Podcast!\n\nThanks to this awesome community I built a website for Total War fans, gamers, and history nerds.
