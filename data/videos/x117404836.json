    "description": "AMAZING SNOW AMBUSH BATTLE - Third Age Total War Reforged Mod Gameplay - Today we have an amazing battle.  The about of ambushes in this battle is unreal.  Just when you think a faction is out of the game, they turn it around with an amazing ambush.  This is a 4 player Free For All on a snowy map.  Also Reforged has been recently updated to 0.9.  They added new units and balanced the Mod a bit more.  I have link to the patch down below.
