    "description": "Welcome back to Tug of War!  JackieFish and I decided that it would be best to end the series with this battle.  All or Nothing!  We felt that the series was becoming dull and Tug of War need better rules for late game.  I know some will be upset about this, but I hope you can understand.  This battle is the best battle of the Series, it's a great way to end it!
