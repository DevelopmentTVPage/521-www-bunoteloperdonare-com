    "description": "Siege of Gondolin - \nGondolin was founded by King Turgon in the First Age. It was originally named Ondolind\u00eb. According to The Silmarillion, the Vala Ulmo, the Lord of Waters, revealed the location of the Vale of Tumladen to Turgon in a dream. Under this divine guidance, Turgon travelled from his kingdom in Nevrast and found the vale. Within the Echoriath, the Encircling Mountains, lay a round level plain with sheer walls on all sides and a ravine and tunnel leading out to the southwest known as the Hidden Way. In the middle of the vale there was a steep hill which was called Amon Gwareth, the \"Hill of Watch\". There Turgon decided to found a city, designed after the city of Tirion in Valinor that the Noldor had left.\nTurgon and his people built Gondolin in secret. After it was completed, he took with him to dwell in the hidden city his entire people in Nevrast \u2014 almost a third of the Noldor of Fingolfin's House \u2014 as well as nearly three quarters of the northern Sindar.\nThe city was a closely guarded secret..nobody who entered , would be entrusted to leave .The defences were further improved by the eagles nesting in the mountains which kept Morgoth's scouts away and the main entrance was in a hidden pass.\nThe Hidden Pass was protected by seven gates, all constantly guarded; the first of wood, then stone, bronze, iron, silver, gold, and steel. The seven gates of Minas Tirith echoed this notion of a layered defense on a hill.\nTuor one of the edain, had been spent his childhood raised be elves but was soon captured and became a thrall of the easterlings.Later he escaped and became a outlaw but was approached by Ulmo[Valar of the Sea] and given mighty gifts and told to seek out Gondolin and warn them that there doom was upon them .A elven traitor betrayed the location of the city and morgoth withdrew his scouts ...and the elves let down their guard thinking morgoth had given up.\nIt was as the Gondolindrim were celebrating the festival of Tarnin Austa that Morgoth assaulted their city. As the sun went down that day and all the people were out to witness the ending of the day, a red glow grew in the north dyeing the snow on the mountains as blood. Riders fled over the plain bringing the tidings, Morgoth was upon them.\nThe enemy contained dragons [represented by artillery in this scenario], balrogs , wargs and many orcs....Turgon believed that the defenders could hold out but he still sent his people to safety using a secret escape route where they exited the mountains , these peoples where escorted to safety by the help of the eagles and a elf named legolas with some of his woodland folk.\nWill morgoth complete the destruction of one of the great elven cities or will they resist the hordes of darkness...\nerrdata : The elven king should be Turgon and the other general should have been Ecthelion but the names are not allowed for in the script\nAdvice : Elfes - your stamina is excellent ..you can run and fight without suffering fatigue..find some good choke points and use your artillery well\nMordor - Your orcs&goblins tire easily but you have plenty of artillery and numbers on your side.With the Balrogs and Trolls you have some excellent hard hitting units\n.use them well\n\nLearn More: \nhttp:\/\/tolkiengateway.net\/wiki\/The_Fall_of_Gondolin\nhttp:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Fall_of_Gondolin\n\nPlay the Battle:\nSingleplayer: http:\/\/www.mediafire.com\/download\/edbbvlrw9zt80a4\/Siege_Gondolin.rar\n\nMultiplayer: http:\/\/www.mediafire.com\/download\/9wttpoxv5m4noy9\/Siege_GondolinMv3.rar",
