We are in the middle of the Polish-Teutonic war, and after many victories, the Teutonic order sent home 1\/3 of their army.  But Polish spies have noticed the movement of troops and have set up an ambush!  Poland must use terrain to beat their foe, and the Teutonic Order must use number to survive the Ambush!  This battle is fought using the Medieval Kingdoms Total War Mod for Total War Attila.
