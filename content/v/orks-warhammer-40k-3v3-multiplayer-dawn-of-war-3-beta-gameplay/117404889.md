    "description": "Dawn of War 3: \nThanks to the open beta of Dawn of War 3 I didn't have a lot of free time this weekend.  I spent most of my weekend playing the game.  I really enjoy it, and what you see here is my 5th game ever as the Orks in Warhammer 40K Dawn of War 3.  This is a 3v3 multiplayer match and both my teammates are playing as the Eldar.  The 3 opponents are playing as the Eldar and Space Marines.  This match has some very epic moments.  Let me know what you think of the game!  Enjoy the Battle and Thanks for watching :D \n\nIf you enjoyed the video don't forget to Like and Leave a comment :D\n\n-----------------------------------------PA Merchandise----------------------------------------------\n\nBUYING A SHIRT WILL SUPPORT A CHARITY!\n\nRepresent the Knight's of Apollo!\nBuy a T-shirt Here: Coming Soon!\n\n----------------------------------How You Can Support Me! -----------------------------------\n\n- Like, share and leave a comment :D\n- Turn OFF adblock or whitelist my channel\n- Send me a GREAT battle Replay: pixelatedapollo@gmail.com\n\n------------------------------------------Connect With Me!-----------------------------------------\n\n- Email: pixelatedapollo@gmail.com\n- Twitter: https:\/\/twitter.com\/PixelatedApollo\n- Steam Group:  http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/groups\/apollosknights\n- Twitch: http:\/\/www.twitch.tv\/pixelatedapollo",
