    "description": "Gettysburg: Pickett's Charge - It is day three of the battle of Gettysburg, and the CSA is ready to make one last push to break through the Union center lines.  \n\nThe battle started with a huge artillery bombardment to try soften up the Union defense, and would be followed up with infantry.  But this would be very ineffective, most of the rebel forces were cut down by rile and artillery fire.  So forces did reach the stone wall that was protecting the Union lines, but they did not hold for long.  It was a decisive defeat that ended the 3 day battle.
